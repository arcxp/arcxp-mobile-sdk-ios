/// Cache directory location options.
///
/// Cache can be stored either in `Caches` directory, or in the `Application Support`
/// directory. Apple used to have documentation about file system use, but it is no
/// longer available. Parts of it are reproduced below.
///
/// **Determining Where to Store Your App-Specific Files**
///
/// The `Library` directory is the designated repository for files your app creates
/// and manages on behalf of the user.
///
///  - Use the `Application Support` directory for:
///    - Resource and data files that your app creates and manages for the user. You
///      might use this directory to store app state information, computed or downloaded
///      data, or even user created data that you manage on behalf of the user.
///    - Autosave files.
///  - Use the `Caches` directory for cached data files or any files that your app can
///    re-create easily.
///  - Read and write preferences using the `UserDefaults` class. This class automatically
///    writes preferences to the appropriate location.
